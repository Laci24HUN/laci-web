    Trouble
    Blood is in the rocky waters
    Hide away your sons and daughters
    Eat you alive

    Levels
    Better put your head on swivels
    Dancing with the very devil
    Butter to knife
    You think you're better than them
    Better than them
    You think they're really your friends
    Really your friends
    But when it comes to the end
    To the end

    You're just the same as them
    Same as them (ha ha ha ha ha)
    So let it go, let it go
    That's the way that it goes
    First you're in, then you're out
    Everybody knows

    You're hot, then you're cold
    You're a light in the dark
    Just you wait and you'll see
    That you're swimmin' with sharks
    He's comin' to get you
    (Chick, chicka) woo, woo
    He's comin' to get you, get
    (Chicka) woo
    Bubbles

    Drownin', you're seein' doubles
    Don't you let 'em see your struggles
    Hiding your tears
    Crisis

    Take advantage off your niceness
    Cut you up in even slices
    Prey on your fears
    You think you're better than them
    Better than them (you think you're better)
    You think they're really your friends
    Really your friends (really)
    But when it comes to the end
    To the end (oh, no)

    You're just the same as them
    Same as them (ha ha ha ha ha)
    So let it go, let it go
    That's the way that it goes
    First you're in, then you're out
    Everybody knows (ooh)

    You're hot, then you're cold
    You're a light in the dark
    Just you wait and you'll see
    That you're swimmin' with sharks
    he's comin' to get you

    (Don't take it from me) woo, woo
    (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you, get
    (Don't take it from me)

    (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you
    (Don't take it from me) woo, woo
    (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you, get
    (Don't take it from me)

    Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe
    I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy
    My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me
    Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything
    (Sharks)

    Don't take it from me
    My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks)
    Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything
    So let it go, let it go

    That's the way that it goes
    First you're in, then you're out
    Everybody knows

    You're hot, then you're cold
    You're a light in the dark
    Just you wait and you'll see
    That you're swimmin' with sharks
    he's comin' to get you

    (Don't take it from me) woo, woo
    (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you, get
    (Don't take it from me)

    (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you
    (Don't take it from me) woo, woo

    (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you, get
    (Don't take it from me)
